HTMX goodies
============

A set of handy utilities for easily obtaining the htmx library and its extensions locally on your computer.

htmx
----

.. cappa:: falco.commands.Htmx

Download the htmx javascript library. You wonâ€™t have to download htmx or its extensions often but at least if you need it, I think this
is an easy way to get the file available locally.

htmx-ext
--------

This command downloads an htmx extension. The list of extensions is pulled from `htmx-extensions.oluwatobi.dev <https://htmx-extensions.oluwatobi.dev/>`_. If you run
the command without specifying any arguments, it will list all the available extensions instead.

.. cappa:: falco.commands.HtmxExtension

**Example**

.. code-block:: bash

   falco htmx-ext sse
